The attached files are codes for my project titled 'Identifying optimal means of predicting customer lifetime value in non-contractual businesses'.

Chapter 3 - Use the code file titled "Descriptive analaysis - chapter 3": descriptive analysis of the original dataset which can be downloaded from https://archive-beta.ics.uci.edu/dataset/502/online+retail+ii This file is too big to be provided here.

Chapter 4 - Use the files "EDA - chapter 4" and the dataset "data": Exploratory data analysis of the processed dataset.

For the models:
GLM model - Use the file "GLM model build and evaluation"
BG/NBD/GG model - Use the files "BG NBD GG model' and the datasets "datanew.csv" and "processed data" (which can be downloaded from https://livenorthumbriaac-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/g/personal/w21058408_northumbria_ac_uk/EYkmDAkjLABMrPcWKPi7ZWwB2kuhnhP3TPP_ZdhbWVjYLg?e=bAPzKe)

All code files are R files except that of BG/NBD/GG which is a python file.
